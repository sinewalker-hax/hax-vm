#Bootstrap files

Files beginning with a digit are sourced by the Vagrant Provissioner. They will
be sourced in alphanumeric order.

The other files are just other package groups you may want to optionally
install, by sourcing them, for example:

> source /vagrant/bootstrap/database

this would source (and execute) code to install database packages. You only
need to do this once when bringing up a new virtual machine. The point being
these non-numbered files contain common package groups which I don't necessarily
always want to install.
